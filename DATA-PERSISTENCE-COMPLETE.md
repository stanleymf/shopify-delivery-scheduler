# ✅ Data Persistence Implementation Complete

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Issue**: Every time you refreshed the admin dashboard, all configuration settings returned to default values. Changes were not persisting between sessions.

**Solution**: Integrated complete database persistence with automatic saving and loading of all configuration data.

## 🚀 What's Now Working

### ✅ Auto-Persistent Data
All these configurations now automatically persist between refreshes and deployments:

- **🌍 Delivery Areas** (5 Singapore zones pre-configured)
- **⏰ Global Timeslots** (Morning/Afternoon delivery + Collection windows)
- **🚗 Express Timeslots** (Quick delivery options with fees)
- **📅 Day Assignments** (Which timeslots are available on which days)
- **❌ Blocked Dates & Timeslots** (Holiday and maintenance blocks)
- **📋 Advance Order Rules** (Global and product-specific booking windows)
- **🏪 Collection Locations** (Store pickup points)

### ✅ Auto-Save Technology

**How it works:**
1. **On Load**: Admin dashboard automatically fetches all saved configuration from the database
2. **On Change**: Every time you modify any setting, it's automatically saved to the database
3. **On Refresh**: Data loads instantly from the database (no more defaults!)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Layer
- **JSON File Storage**: `apps/api/data/` directory with individual files for each data type
- **Backup System**: Timestamped backups created on demand
- **RESTful API**: 15+ endpoints for CRUD operations on all data types

### Frontend Integration
- **Persistence Hook**: `useDataPersistence.ts` handles all save/load operations
- **Auto-Save Effects**: React useEffect hooks trigger saves on data changes
- **Smart Loading**: Loads persistent data on app initialization
