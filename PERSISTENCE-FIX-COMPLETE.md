# ✅ Data Persistence Fix Complete

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

**Issue Resolved**: Configuration settings were reverting to default/empty values on every refresh despite having persistence infrastructure in place.

**Root Cause**: React useState was initializing with default data arrays, which triggered auto-save effects immediately, overwriting the persistent database with empty/default values before the actual data could be loaded.

## 🔧 Solution Implemented

### 1. **Empty State Initialization**
- Changed all useState declarations to start with empty arrays: `[]`
- Removed hardcoded default values that were overriding persistent data

### 2. **Smart Auto-Save Logic**
- Added `isInitialLoadComplete` ref to track when data has been loaded
- Modified auto-save useEffect hooks to only save AFTER initial load completes
- Prevents race condition between default state and persistent data loading

### 3. **Load-First Architecture**
- Data persistence hook loads from database first
- Only after successful load (or load failure), auto-save is enabled
- User changes are then auto-saved immediately

4. **Verify your changes are still there** ✅

### Step 3: Test Auto-Save
1. **Go to Settings tab**
2. **Look for "Auto-Save Active" green indicator**
3. **Add a new delivery area** 
4. **Refresh immediately** 
5. **New area should still be there** ✅

### Step 4: Test Other Data Types
1. **Create a global timeslot** → Refresh → Should persist ✅
2. **Block a date** → Refresh → Should persist ✅
3. **Add an advance rule** → Refresh → Should persist ✅
